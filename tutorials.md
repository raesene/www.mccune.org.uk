[Iximiuz Labs](https://labs.iximiuz.com/dashboard) is a great learning site that has a load of interactive tutorials on various topics.

As I've generated a lot of container and Kubernetes security training content over the years, I've always wanted a location where people could explore this and learn independently, so I've started adding some of it as tutorials on the labs site. 

## Available Tutorials

- [Containers are processes](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/containers-are-processes-d17b1df8). This is a core thing to understand when thinking about containers, the idea that, from the operating system's perspective, a container is just a set of processes. This tutorial shows how that works and shows some useful ways that Linux tools can be used to interact with containers.

- [An Introduction to Docker Security](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/docker-security-introduction-a859718d). This tutorial starts by exploring a a bit about the architecture of Docker, then moves on to explore its attack surface, and show some basic container breakout techniques.
