type: post

In this session, we’re going to get a bit meta and talk about giving talks, why you should do it, and how to get started. We’ll bust some persistent myths about speaking at conferences, show how everyone has something worth sharing, and let you in on some of the secrets of how conference talk applications work. At the end of it all, hopefully this session will help you take the first step toward the stage.

This talk was delivered as a keynote at [KCD UK 2025](https://sessionize.com/view/yz0a7tia/GridSmart?format=Embed_Styled_Html&isDark=false&title=KCD%20UK%20Edinburgh%202025)
