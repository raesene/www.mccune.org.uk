category: talks

This is a talk given at the Scottish Ruby conference in 2013 around application security and specifically ways in which developers need to focus on application security in areas that their frameworks will not cover. There's a recording of the talk [here](https://youtu.be/CMf6z9GKOuY). It was also delivered for the OWASP EU tour in 2013 (recording [here](https://youtu.be/YutCgyjqgfA))
