This talk looks at supply chain security risks in the open source ecosystem, around things like repository security and examines some of the ways in which an attacker might be able to compromise a package to attack applications which use it.

It was delivered for OWASP Appsec EU in 2015, there's a recording [here](https://youtu.be/Wn190b4EJWk) and the slides are available [here](https://prezi.com/vjjq6n2x72ko/security-and-modern-software-deployment-owasp-edition/)
