title: Too Much to Choose – Making Sense of a Smorgasbord of Security Standard
type: post
category: talks
---

This is a talk looking at the Kubernetes security standards landscape in 2022. It talks a bit about how security standards work and how companies can and should use them. It then looks at the practical side of how to do standards compliance scanning against Kubernetes clusters. 

This talk was developed in conjunction with [Anaïs Urlichs](https://twitter.com/urlichsanais) and was presented at Kube Con 2022 in Valencia. There's a recording of the presentation from Kubecon [here](https://youtu.be/yKqqCxvlDeE) and the slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1twh2zDEndIcIi7Ny-eb1tng_sdM81gsDc-s6u4X4ncs/edit?usp=sharing)
