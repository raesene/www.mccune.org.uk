 Over the last 10 years Docker and Kubernetes have gone from niche projects to being a ubiquitous part of the technology landscape, operating in a vast number of companies and environments. But why were they so successful?

This talk will examine the sources of success that these technologies had, look at what seems like it should have been important but wasn't, and provide ideas for how future open source projects can set themselves up for success. 

This talk was delivered at the State Of Open Con 2025, and there's a video of the talk [here](https://youtu.be/sDFuxuKmYLE?si=MqG_VyxsDGnuyHSg)
