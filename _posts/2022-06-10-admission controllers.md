type: post

---

Admission control is an important part of Kubernetes security, helping to secure the workloads you run in your clusters and taking on wider responsibilities for the smooth running of your environment. At the moment itâ€™s a rapidly changing landscape with the deprecation of Kubernetes Pod Security Policies and several new options like OPA and Kyverno rapidly gaining adoption. This talk looks at why admission control is such an important topic, and compare some of the main alternatives you might want to deploy in your clusters.  

This talk was delivered for the Kubernetes Geneva group, there's a recording from that event [here](https://youtu.be/1d5K9EKzMVY)
