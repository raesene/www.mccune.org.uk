The world of Kubernetes security can seem a bit daunting when you're getting started, with a load of areas to look at and a panoply of tools that can be used. From authentication, to authorization, workload security and network policies, there's a lot to think about.

This talk will help you work out where to start, give you some ideas on what's likely to be important for your cluster and talk about some of the key open source projects you can use to keep your environments secure.

This talk has been delivered at Kubernetes Community Day UK in 2021 [here](https://youtu.be/W2q91qvr4gc) and for the London Java Community in 2022 [here](https://youtu.be/SbqeSw_teWU)
