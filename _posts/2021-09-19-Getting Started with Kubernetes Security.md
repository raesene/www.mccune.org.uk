This is a introductory talk around Kubernetes security. The premise is to look at what the "one thing" you could start with in terms of improving cluster security might be. It was delivered at Kubernetes Community Day UK in 2021 . There's a link to the recording from that conference [here](https://youtu.be/W2q91qvr4gc)
