type: post
category: talks
---

Now that containers, Docker and Kubernetes are everywhere, we have to ask the most important question 'how do we hack them!' . This talk will take a look at some of the underpinnings of how these systems work, to give you ideas on where to start and then look at some classic container hacking techniques.

This talk was delivered to the Ekoparty conference in 2021. There's a link to the recording from that conference [here](https://youtu.be/jVdYlQx2MCE)
