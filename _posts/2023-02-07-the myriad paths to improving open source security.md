If you're looking to contribute to open source security, it can sometimes be tricky to think of where and how you can contribute, especially if you're not a developer. In this talk we'll examine some of the ways where you can help improve open source security regardless of your technical background, talk about their pros and cons and also talk about how your ideas for security can have a global impact.

This talk was delivered for the State of Open conference in 2023, there's a recording from that event [here](https://youtu.be/teXoxssTxs4)
