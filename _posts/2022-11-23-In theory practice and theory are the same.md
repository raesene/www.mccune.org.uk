title: In theory, thereâ€™s no difference between practice and theory
type: post

When looking at how Kubernetes should be used it can be tempting to compare yourself to the ideal architectures where everything is updated and perfectly configured. However, in reality things are rarely so clean and clear. This talk will look at some interesting places where theory and practice can be seen to diverge based on real-world data from a 2022 survey of Kubernetes and container installations.

This talk was delivered for the Kubernetes Community Day - UK conference, there's a recording from that event [here](https://youtu.be/v4CC1hj2c8E)
