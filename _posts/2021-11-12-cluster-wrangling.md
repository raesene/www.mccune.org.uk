From years of working with numerous firms on doing k8s the right way, come and learn the best way to deploy clusters, what does and what doesn’t work and more importantly learn how to adopt strategies to help your clusters stay secure.

This talk was delivered to OWASP Appsec US in 2021. There's a recording of the talk [here](https://youtu.be/8yAkERzcLCg)
