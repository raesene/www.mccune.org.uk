title: The secret life of Kubernetes containers
type: post
category: talks
---

One of the great things about using containers is that most of the time you don’t have to think about what’s happening under the covers. Tools like Docker and Kubernetes do a great job of hiding complexity from their users. However, sometimes things go wrong and when they do, it’s very helpful to understand the details of what’s happening and also how to interact with containers at a low level to debug the problem. Fortunately, most of what containerization tools do is just Linux, and as a result it’s possible to use existing Linux tools to interact with and debug them. This talk will take a look under the covers of Linux containers, explain what’s going on and provide some practical tips on how you can leverage tools that are likely already available to troubleshoot them.

This talk was delivered at KCD UK 2023, there's a recording from that event [here](https://youtu.be/zByo74nx-Ak?si=jNd4YeJISPHPlusk)
