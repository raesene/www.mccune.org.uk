7 Years ago , an attempt was made to kill off pentesting at the inaugural BSides London with my talk "Pentesting must die".... It failed and pentesting arose stronger, like a zombie from the grave.  
So I'm back to try and finally end its scourge and this time we're aiming for the head.  
This talk will cover why pentesting is a horrible and much abused term that should be put out its misery, and provide advice on what you should do once it's finally gone.

This talk was given at BSides Leeds in 2018, there's a recording [here](https://youtu.be/Ndd8irMjUB8). It's a successor to another talk given at BSides London in 2011 called "Penetration testing must die", of which there is a recording [here](https://youtu.be/MyifS9cQ4X0)
