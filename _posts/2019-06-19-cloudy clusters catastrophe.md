Kubernetes and containerization, in general, have been taking the computing industry by storm, with huge adoption across a wide range of business sectors.
As with any new technology, especially one as fast-moving as containerization, there is always the risk of new security weaknesses creeping into deployments.
This talk will provide an overview of containerization and the major security challenges that come with it as well as providing practical guidance on how to address them.

This talk was delivered for the Infosec in the City conference in 2019 and a recording is available [here](https://youtu.be/Cs7Ted3Fxog) and also at Securi-Tay in 2018, recording [here](https://youtu.be/a8o13x5aWaw)
