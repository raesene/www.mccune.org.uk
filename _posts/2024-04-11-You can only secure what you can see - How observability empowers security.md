OpenTelemetry has become the standardized way of gaining visibility into application activity. There's a golden opportunity for security teams to work with wider IT organizations to leverage the benefits of improved observability, in modern environments based on GKE clusters. We'll look at combining data from the application layer with the other layers of a modern cloud native stack to get deep visibility into activity and show how this enhanced observability can improve everyone's security.

This talk was delivered at Google Cloud Next 2024, there's a recording from that event [here](https://youtu.be/xD-IjRAEYh8?si=dVce43lQtTnY0_OR)
