title: Docker - Security Myths, Security Legends
type: post

You can't have helped seeing the rise of containerization in general and Docker specifically in the tech press. From reading articles on the subject it's easy to be left confused about whether Docker is the greatest thing since sliced bread or a pile of buzzwords that doesn't solve any real problems. This talk will take you through what docker actually means from a security perspective, how it can be used and misused and how it might be useful to make your life a bit easier.

This talk was given at BSides London 2016, and there's a recording [here](https://youtu.be/uQigvjSXMLw)
