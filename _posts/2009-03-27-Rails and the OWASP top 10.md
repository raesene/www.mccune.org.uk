title: Web Application Security. Rails and the OWASP Top 10
type: post
category: talks
---

This is a talk looking at the relatively new (at the time) Ruby on Rails framework and how it does and does not address some of the web application security concerns from the OWASP Top 10. 

It was delivered for the Scotland on Rails conference in 2009 and there's a recording [here](https://youtu.be/m-v8WRLhIQA)
